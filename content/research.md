## Pulsar Timing Arrays

![Pulsar Timing Array](/images/pta_champion.png)

The main thrust of my research is **searching for nanohertz gravitational waves** from distant sources using a web of Milky Way pulsars (a Pulsar Timing Array), and unveiling the properties of the supermassive black holes, cosmic strings, or early Universe processes that produce these GWs.

**Pulsars** are rapidly rotating, highly magnetized neutron stars that emit beams of radiation along their magnetic field axis. Millisecond pulsars (**MSPs**) spin hundreds of times a second with extraordinarily stable pulse arrival times, making them natural clocks in the sky.

> **🎉 June 29, 2023**: I announced NANOGrav's groundbreaking evidence for a cosmic background of nanohertz-frequency gravitational waves at NSF Headquarters, alongside Kip Thorne and Jocelyn Bell-Burnell.

I have developed many of the signal models, statistical techniques, and coding infrastructure underlying the global pulsar timing array effort.
