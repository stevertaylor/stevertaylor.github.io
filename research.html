											<h3>Black Holes</h3>
											<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/blackhole.jpeg" alt="" /></a>
											<p>
												These are the most compact objects in the Universe, with masses spanning
												from a few to a few tens of billions of times that of the Sun. They can
												be formed in different ways, from being the endpoint of stellar evolution,
												to being the result of the direct collapse of proto-galactic disks.

											<h3>Neutron Stars & Pulsars</h3>
											<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/pulsar.jpg" alt="" /></a>
											<p>
												These are the second-most dense object in the Universe, beaten only by
												black holes. They resist gravitational collapse through neutron-degeneracy
												pressure, having masses similar to the Sun but packed into a space equivalent to
												a city. Rapidly rotating neutron stars act like dynamos, generating
												powerful radiation that is beamed along their magnetic field axis.

											<h3>Data Science</h3>

											<p>Teasing out patterns or signals from data, inferring the odds
												with which certain hypotheses are favoured by data, and quantifying
												our certainty or ignorance of the properties of the physical Universe
												are all the realm of statistical inference. The techniques we need are rich,
												diverse and fun. Full disclosure, I am a Bayesian.

											<h3>NANOGrav</h3>

											<p>
												The North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational waves is a
												collaborative enterprise of many universities and radio facilities, involving
												~100 researchers, and performing precision timing of more than 70 MSPs.
												We are currently generously funded as an NSF Physics Frontier Center. US
												facilities like the Arecibo Radio Telescope and the Green Bank Telescope are
												important for our ongoing successes.

											<h3>International Pulsar Timing Array</h3>

												The IPTA is the collaborative union of NANOGrav, the European Pulsar
												Timing Array (EPTA), the Parkes Pulsar Timing Array (PPTA), and emerging
												regional PTAs in South Africa, India, and China. Together, we have observed
												over 60 MSPs pulsars for more than 15 years.

											<h3>LIGO</h3>
											<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/ligo.jpg" alt="" /></a>
											<p>
												The Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory made the first
												detection of GWs on September 14th, 2015. There are detectors in
												Livingston, Louisiana and Hanford, Washington, and have since been joined
												by the Virgo detector in Italy. LIGO detects black holes that are a few
												tens the mass of the Sun, and systems with neutron stars. The emerging
												catalog of detections is fostering a new era of compact-object demography.

											<h3>LISA</h3>
											<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/lisa.jpg" alt="" /></a>
											<p>
												The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna is a joint ESA-NASA mission
												project for launch in ~2034. Three satellites will orbit the Sun at separations of
												~2.5 million kilometers from one another. The mission will access the
												millihertz band of GW frequencies, where many Milky Way white-dwarf
												binary systems and massive black hole mergers await. These black holes are
												less massive than what PTAs can see, but LISA will be able to perform
												exquisite fundamental tests of gravity.

									<h3>Pulsar Timing Arrays</h3>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/pta_champion.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p>
										<b>The main thrust of my research is searching for nanohertz gravitational waves (GWs)
										from distant sources using a web of Milky Way pulsars (a Pulsar Timing Array), and
										unveiling the properties of the supermassive black holes, cosmic strings, or early
										Universe processes that produce these GWs.</b>
									</p>
									<p>
										<b>Pulsars</b> are rapidly rotating, highly magnetized neutron stars that emit
										beams of radiation along their magnetic field axis. The misalignment
										of their magnetic field axis with their rotational axis means that they act like
										<b>lighthouses</b>, swinging beams of radiation into our line-of-sight to be registered
										as pulses.
									</p>
									<p>
										Millisecond pulsars (<b>MSPs</b>) spin hundreds of times a second, and have such
										stable and predictable pulse arrival times that we can use them as natural clocks in the sky.
										I work with colleagues in <b>NANOGrav</b> (North American Nanohertz Observatory for
										Gravitational Waves), and the <b>International Pulsar Timing Array</b> (IPTA) to search
										within deviations of pulse arrival times from highly-accurate models.
										It is in these deviations (or "residuals") where we will find <b>gravitational waves</b>.
										<b>
											I have developed many of the signal models, statistical techniques, and coding
											infrastructure that underlies the global effort for PTAs to be the next great
											GW observatory in the 2020s.
										</b>
									</p>
									<p>
										GWs in the PTA band (~1-100 nHz) are highly likely to originate from a cosmological
										<b>population of inspiraling supermassive binary black holes</b> (SMBBHs), with masses
										~10<sup>8</sup> - 10<sup>10</sup>M<sub>&#x2609</sub>. Most massive galaxies are
										thought to harbor massive black holes at their center, so these binares form as a
										natural by-product of merger-induced galaxy growth. In fact, we expect the first
										signal to be detected will be the aggregate signal from all binaries added together.
										This <b>GW background</b> affects all pulsars in a correlated way.
										<b>
											My work has shown that
											we are only ~3-7 years away from detecting it, followed by individual bright systems.
											I have also developed powerful strategies for mining information about the
											underlying properties and environments of SMBBHs from PTA detections of GW signals.
